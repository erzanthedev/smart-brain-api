# 🧠 Smart Brain React App - BACKEND
---

## 📋 Overview

Welcome to the **Smart Brain React App** project! 🚀

This project is a web application that uses an AI-powered face detection API from Clarifai to identify faces in images.
**At the moment it only detects single face images**
AI, or **Artificial Intelligence**, refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. **APIs** (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software applications to communicate with each other, enabling the integration of external services like Clarifai’s face detection into your own app.

In this project, I focused on building the **backend** and **database**, which are crucial components of any full-stack application. This allowed me to deepen my understanding of server-side development and data management.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

Here's a breakdown of the technologies and tools I used to build the backend and database:

- **Node.js & Express.js**: For the backend, to manage server-side logic, handle API requests, and route data between the frontend and database.
- **PostgreSQL**: For the database, to securely store and manage user data.
- **Heroku**: To host the database and deploy the backend, ensuring the application is accessible online.

## 📚 What I Learned

This project provided me with in-depth knowledge and experience in backend development:

- **Server-Side Logic with Node.js & Express.js**: Built and managed the server-side logic, handling user authentication, API requests, and routing.
- **Database Design and Management**: Created and structured the PostgreSQL database to store user information, including secured login credentials and image data.
- **API Integration**: Integrated the Clarifai face detection API with the backend, handling the API requests and responses efficiently.
- **Security Practices**: Used `bcrypt` for hashing passwords, ensuring that user credentials are stored securely and that user privacy is maintained during authentication.
- **Deployment and Hosting**: Deployed the backend and database on Heroku, managing environment variables and ensuring that the application is production-ready.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to hone my backend development skills by building a robust server and database that supports a full-stack application. This experience allowed me to understand the intricacies of managing data, securing user information, and integrating external APIs with a backend server. It was a comprehensive test of my ability to build and deploy a fully functional backend infrastructure.
